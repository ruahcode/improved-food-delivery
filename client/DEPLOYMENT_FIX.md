# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
The frontend was failing to load data because components were using hardcoded `localhost:5000` URLs instead of the production API URL.

## Solution
1. Created a centralized API configuration utility (`src/utils/api.js`)
2. Updated all components to use environment-based API URLs
3. Ensured production environment file is correctly configured

## Files Updated
- `src/utils/api.js` - New centralized API configuration
- `src/components/home/SpecialOffers.jsx`
- `src/components/home/PopularRestaurants.jsx`
- `src/pages/RestaurantListing.jsx`
- `src/components/RestaurantCard.jsx`
- `src/pages/CategoryResults.jsx`
- `src/pages/Orders.jsx`
- `src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`
- `src/components/admin/ProductManager.jsx`

## Environment Configuration
Production environment (`.env.production`) is correctly set to:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://improved-food-delivery.onrender.com/api
```

## Next Steps
1. Redeploy the frontend to Render
2. The application should now correctly connect to the backend API
3. Data should load properly on the deployed site

## Verification
After redeployment, check:
- Special offers section loads
- Popular restaurants display
- Restaurant listing page works
- All API calls use the correct production URL
