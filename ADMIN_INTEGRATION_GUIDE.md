## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Admin Access Denied**:
   - Ensure user has admin role
   - Check JWT token validity
   - Verify admin middleware

2. **Charts Not Loading**:
   - Check Chart.js dependencies
   - Verify API responses
   - Check console for errors

3. **API Errors**:
   - Verify server is running
   - Check database connection
   - Validate request headers

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check admin user exists
node server/test-admin.js

# View server logs
cd server && npm run dev

# Check client console
# Open browser dev tools
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All admin routes require valid JWT tokens
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for admin features
3. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
4. **Error Handling**: No sensitive information exposed in errors
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented on authentication endpoints

The admin dashboard is now fully integrated and ready for production use!
