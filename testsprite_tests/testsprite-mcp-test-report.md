## 4️⃣ Critical Issues Summary

### 🔴 HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES (13 tests)

1. **Frontend Resource Loading Failures**: Multiple `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` errors prevent UI components from rendering
2. **WebSocket Connection Failures**: Vite HMR connections failing, affecting development experience
3. **Backend API Failures**: Critical endpoints like `/api/user/login`, `/api/user/register`, `/api/restaurant/all` returning empty responses
4. **Authentication System Down**: Registration and login completely non-functional
5. **Data Loading Failures**: Restaurant data, menu items, and promotional content cannot be retrieved
6. **Password Recovery Non-functional**: Forgot password functionality completely broken

### 🟡 MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES (2 tests)

1. **Rate Limiting Partially Functional**: Working on login but failing on registration
2. **UI Responsiveness Incomplete**: Desktop working but tablet/mobile untested due to data issues

### 🟢 WORKING FEATURES (2 tests)

1. **Login Form Validation**: Correctly rejects incorrect passwords
2. **JWT Authorization**: Properly enforces protected route access

---

## 5️⃣ Recommendations for Immediate Action

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Infrastructure
1. **Investigate Server Configuration**: Check Vite dev server and backend server configurations
2. **Fix Resource Loading**: Resolve `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` errors preventing frontend rendering
3. **Restore Backend APIs**: Fix authentication endpoints and restaurant data APIs
4. **Fix WebSocket Connections**: Resolve Vite HMR connection issues

### Priority 2: Restore Core Functionality
1. **Fix User Authentication**: Restore registration and login flows
2. **Fix Data Loading**: Restore restaurant and menu data retrieval
3. **Fix Password Recovery**: Implement functional password reset functionality

### Priority 3: Complete Testing
1. **Re-run Authentication Tests**: Once fixed, validate user registration and login
2. **Test Core Features**: Validate shopping cart, orders, and payment flows
3. **Complete UI Testing**: Test responsiveness across all device sizes

---

## 6️⃣ Technical Debt and Code Quality

- **Frontend**: Multiple resource loading failures suggest build or deployment configuration issues
- **Backend**: API endpoints returning empty responses indicate server configuration or database connection problems
- **Authentication**: Complete failure suggests either backend service issues or database connectivity problems
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error messages and lack of proper fallback UI states
